A diverse group of leading policymakers, people with diabetes, clinicians, advocates, and industry stakeholders to discuss the deep and unparalleled cost of living with diabetes\u2014from the price of insulin and other drugs to the costs borne as a result of certain insurance practices, to the costs of hospitalization and outpatient treatment, to the enormous expense of devices and supplies, diabetes places, and outsized burden on those afflicted with the disease.

The body breaks down the carbohydrates you eat into blood glucose (blood sugar) that it uses for energy\u2014and insulin is a hormone that the body needs to get glucose from the bloodstream into the cells of the body. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes\u2014and it means that your body doesn\u2019t use insulin properly. And while some people can control their blood glucose levels with healthy eating and exercise, others may need medication or insulin to help manage it. Specific types of diabetes due to other causes, for example monogenic diabetes syndromes (such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young), diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis), and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as with glucocorticoid use, in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, or after organ transplantation). As the placenta supports the baby as it grows, sometimes hormones block the action of the mother\u2019s insulin to her body and it causes a problem called insulin resistance. Gestational diabetes can also start when the mother\u2019s body is not able to make and use all the insulin it needs for pregnancy. Part of living with diabetes is fluctuations in your blood glucose levels. Here's what you need to do when your blood glucose level drops low.\u00a0 Working with your diabetes care team on your treatment plan will help you reach your health targets, feel healthy, and lower your risk for diabetes complications.

It's also a critical step in forming your game plan to manage diabetes with your diabetes care team. This   can tell you a lot. The test results give you a picture of your average blood glucose (blood sugar) level over the past two to three months. The higher the levels, the greater your risk of developing diabetes complications. Your doctor will tell you how often you need the A1C test, but usually\u00a0you\u2019ll have the test at least twice a year if you\u2019re meeting your treatment goals. If you're not meeting your goals or you change treatments, you may need to get an A1C test more often. When it comes to the numbers, there's no one-size-fits-all target. A1C target levels can vary by each person's age and other factors, and your target may be different from someone else's. The goal for most adults with diabetes is an A1C that is less than 7%. A1C test results are reported as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood glucose levels over the past two to three months. The A1C test can also be used for diagnosis, based on the following guidelines: \u00a0 \u00a0 Another term you may come across when finding out your A1C is eAG.

The Economic Report, which is published every five years, found that the total annual cost of diabetes in 2022 is $412.9 billion, including $306.6 billion in direct medical costs and $106.3 billion in indirect costs. People with diagnosed diabetes now account for one of every four health care dollars spent in the U.S. \u201cWe now know that medical costs for people living with diabetes increased by 35% over the past 10 years. The ADA\u2019s Economic Report reaffirms that, in addition to its enormous physical and health burden, diabetes also carries an untenable cost burden that is often disproportionately borne by vulnerable and underserved communities,\u201d said Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Henderson, the ADA\u2019s CEO. \u201cReducing the cost of diabetes is essential to improving the lives of all people with diabetes. November is American Diabetes Month\u00ae, and as we continue our fight to end diabetes, we urge policymakers and the entire health care system to see this report as a call to action to prioritize affordable diabetes care.\u201d The Economic Report includes data on diabetes prevalence, total direct medical costs, and average annual medical expenditures. Primary cost drivers include increased use of prescription medications beyond glucose lowering medications, hospital inpatient services, reduced work productivity, and unemployment. The authors of the Economic Report included a multidisciplinary team of leading U.S. experts in the field of diabetes care and costs, including physicians, epidemiologists, endocrinologists, health care researchers, economists, data scientists, and academics. The full Economic Costs of Diabetes in the US in 2022 report is available   and will appear in the December issue of ADA journal,  \u00a0 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) is the nation\u2019s leading voluntary health organization fighting to bend the curve on the diabetes epidemic and help people living with diabetes thrive. For 83 years, the ADA has driven discovery and research to treat, manage, and prevent diabetes while working relentlessly for a cure.
