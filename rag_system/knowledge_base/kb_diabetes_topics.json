The pancreas is an organ that makes   to help your body break down and use food. Islets contain several types of cells, including beta cells that make the hormone insulin. Insulin helps your body use glucose for energy and helps control your blood glucose levels, also called blood sugar.  In people with  , the body\u2019s   attacks and destroys the beta cells. People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their bodies no longer make this hormone.  In the type of islet transplantation used to treat type 1 diabetes, also called islet allo-transplantation, doctors take islets with healthy beta cells from the pancreas of a deceased organ donor. Doctors then inject the healthy islet cells taken from the donor into a vein that carries blood to the liver of a person with type 1 diabetes. A person receiving a transplant is called a recipient. These islets begin to make and release insulin in the recipient\u2019s body. More than one injection of transplanted islet cells is often needed to stop using insulin. \nFor many years, islet transplantation was considered experimental and was only performed in clinical trials. However, in 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first cell therapy made from islets of deceased donors for use in islet transplantation. This cell therapy is approved for adults with type 1 diabetes who have a hard time managing their blood glucose levels and continue to have repeated severely low blood glucose, also called severe  , despite intensive diabetes management and education.\n Islet transplantation may help people with type 1 diabetes A whole   is another procedure that can give a person with type 1 diabetes healthy beta cells. However, a pancreas transplant is a major surgery that carries a greater risk of complications than an islet transplant.  Not all people with type 1 diabetes are good candidates for islet transplantation. Certain people with type 1 diabetes who have blood glucose levels that are difficult to manage, experience severe hypoglycemia, and have hypoglycemia unawareness\u2014a dangerous condition in which a person can\u2019t feel or recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia\u2014may be candidates. Doctors consider people for islet transplantation if the possible  , such as being better able to reach blood glucose targets without problems such as hypoglycemia, outweigh the  , such as the possible side effects of immunosuppressants. Immunosuppressants are medicines that recipients must take to prevent their immune system from attacking and destroying the transplanted islets. People who have type 1 diabetes and have had, or are planning to have, a   to treat   may be candidates for islet transplantation. Islet transplantation may be performed at the same time as or after a kidney transplant. Kidney transplant recipients will already be taking   to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney. Therefore, the islet transplant does not add much more risk. Special   are used to remove islets from the pancreas of a deceased donor. The islets are purified and counted in a lab. On average, about 400,000 islets are transplanted in each procedure. The transplant recipient will most often receive a local   and a sedative\u2014medicine to help you relax\u2014for the procedure. In some cases, the recipient may receive general anesthesia. The islet transplant infusion procedure involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through a small cut in the recipient\u2019s upper  . A   uses   and   to guide the catheter into the   of the  . The islets are slowly infused through the catheter and into the liver by gravity. Alternatively, a minimally invasive open procedure can be used to directly visualize a vein near the liver to insert the catheter. Over the next 2 weeks, new   form and connect the islets with the blood vessels of the recipient.  The beta cells in the islets begin to make and release insulin into the bloodstream immediately after transplant.  Recipients may see the following benefits Research also suggests that islet transplantation may prevent or slow the development of   such as heart disease, kidney disease, and nerve or eye damage. A   conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored   looked at outcomes associated with islet transplantation. Phase 3 trials test new treatments in large groups of people to confirm that treatments are effective and monitor side effects. Participants in this NIH-sponsored study included people with type 1 diabetes with problems managing their blood glucose levels, such as severe hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness.  The study found that, 1 year after islet transplantation, nearly 9 out of 10 transplant recipients had an   level below 7 percent and did not have episodes of severe hypoglycemia. The A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7 percent. About half of the recipients did not need to take any insulin. Two years after islet transplantation, about 7 out of 10 recipients had an A1C level of less than 7 percent and did not have episodes of severe hypoglycemia, and about 4 out of 10 did not need insulin. Ongoing research from this study also found that islet transplant recipients experienced significant improvements in their diabetes-related quality of life and reported better overall health status after the transplant. Even transplant recipients who still needed to take insulin to manage their diabetes experienced these improvements. Risks of islet transplantation include After an islet transplant, recipients will take medicines, called  , for as long as the transplanted islets are working. These medicines help prevent the body from rejecting the transplanted islets. Rejection occurs when the body\u2019s immune system sees the islets as \u201cforeign\u201d and tries to destroy them. If the recipient stops taking immunosuppressants, the recipient\u2019s body will reject the transplanted islets, and the islets will stop working. Immunosuppressants can have many serious side effects. Possible side effects include Islet transplantation is not a common treatment for type 1 diabetes. In the United States, islet transplantation was considered an experimental treatment for many years and was only performed in clinical trials. With the FDA approval of an islet cell therapy in 2023, islet transplantation is available outside of clinical trials to treat certain adults with type 1 diabetes. The   has reported that, between 1999 and 2015, 1,086 people worldwide received islet transplants for type 1 diabetes.  The CITR collects information on islet transplants performed at research centers in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases established and supports the CITR. Breakthrough T1D, formerly known as JDRF or the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, also helped establish CITR. Islet transplantation is not often used to treat type 1 diabetes because recipients must take immunosuppressants, and donor islets are in short supply. Islet transplant recipients must take long-term immunosuppressants, and these medicines may cause  . Researchers are looking for ways to prevent islet rejection without long-term immunosuppressants. In one approach, called encapsulation, islets are coated with a material that protects them from being attacked by the recipient\u2019s immune system. Only a small number of donor pancreases are available for islet transplantation each year. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, 1,315 pancreases were recovered from deceased donors in 2017.  Many donated pancreases are not suitable for islet isolation. Also, some donor islets may be damaged or destroyed during the transplant process.  Researchers are studying different ways to overcome the short supply of donor islets. For example, scientists are studying ways to transplant islets from pigs or create new human islets from  .\n Doctors may perform a different type of islet transplantation, called islet auto-transplantation, in people who have their whole pancreas removed to treat severe and    . People with type 1 diabetes cannot receive islet auto-transplantation. In islet auto-transplantation, doctors remove a patient\u2019s pancreas, remove the islets from the pancreas, and transplant the islets into the patient\u2019s liver. The goal is to give the body enough healthy islets that make insulin. Patients don\u2019t need to take immunosuppressants after islet auto-transplantation because they receive islets from their own body. Islet auto-transplantation is not considered experimental.

In addition to making healthy food and beverage choices, getting physical activity, getting enough sleep, and managing stress, medicines can help you manage the disease. Some other treatment options are also available.  \nThe medicine you take depends on the type of diabetes you have and how well the medicine controls your  \u00a0levels, also called blood sugar levels. Other factors, such as any other health conditions you may have, medication costs, your insurance coverage and copays, access to care, and your lifestyle, may affect what diabetes medicine you take. If you have  , you must take insulin because your  \u00a0does not make it. You will need to take insulin several times during the day, including when you eat and drink, to control your blood glucose level. There are different ways to  . You can use a needle and  , an  , or an  . An  \u2014also called an automated insulin delivery system\u2014may be another option for some people. Some people with  \u00a0can control their blood glucose level by making lifestyle changes. These lifestyle changes include consuming healthy meals and beverages, limiting calories if they have  \u00a0or  , and getting physical activity. Many people with type 2 diabetes need to take diabetes medicines as well. These medicines may include diabetes pills or medicines you inject, such as insulin. Over time, you may need more than one diabetes medicine to control your blood glucose level. Even if you do not take insulin, you may need it at special times, such as if you are pregnant or if you are in the hospital for treatment. If you have  , you can manage your blood glucose level by following a healthy eating plan and doing a moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking for 150 minutes, each week. If consuming healthy food and beverages and getting regular physical activity aren\u2019t enough to keep your blood glucose level in your target range, a doctor will work with you and may recommend you take insulin. Insulin is safe to take while you are pregnant. No matter what type of diabetes you have, taking diabetes medicines every day can feel like a burden sometimes. New medications and improved delivery systems can help make it easier to manage your blood glucose levels. Talk with your doctor to find out which medications and delivery systems will work best for you and fit into your lifestyle. Several types of insulin are available. Each type starts to work at a different speed, known as \u201conset,\u201d and its effects last a different length of time, known as \u201cduration.\u201d Most types of insulin reach a peak, which is when they have the strongest effect. After the peak, the effects of the insulin wear off over the next few hours or so. Table 1 lists the different types of insulin, how fast they start to work, when they peak, and how long they last. Another type of insulin, called premixed insulin, is a combination of insulins listed in Table 1. Premixed insulin starts to work in 15 to 60 minutes and can last from 10 to 16 hours. The peak time varies depending on which insulins are mixed. Your doctor will work with you to review your medication options. Talk with your doctor about your activity level, what you eat and drink, how well you manage your blood glucose levels, your age and lifestyle, and how long your body takes to absorb insulin. Follow your doctor\u2019s advice on when and how to take your insulin. If you're worried about the cost, talk with your doctor. Some types of insulin cost more than others. You can also find resources to get  . The way you take insulin may depend on your lifestyle, insurance plan, and preferences. Talk with your doctor about the options and which one is best for you. Most people with diabetes take insulin using a needle and syringe, insulin pen, or insulin pump. Inhalers and  \u00a0are less common ways to take insulin. Artificial pancreas systems are now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Talk with your doctor to see if an artificial pancreas is an option for you. You can give yourself insulin shots using a needle and  . You draw up your dose of insulin from the vial\u2014or bottle\u2014through the needle into the syringe. Insulin works fastest when you inject it in your belly, but your doctor may recommend alternating the spot where you inject it. Injecting insulin in the same spot repeatedly could cause the tissue to harden, making it harder to take shots in that area over time. Other spots you can inject insulin include your thigh, buttocks, or upper arm, but it may take longer for the insulin to work from those areas. Some people with diabetes who take insulin need 2 to 4 shots a day to reach their blood glucose targets. Others can take a single shot. Injection aids can help you give yourself the shots. An insulin pen looks like a writing pen but has a needle for its point. Some insulin pens come filled with insulin and are disposable. Others have room for an insulin cartridge that you insert and replace after use. Many people find insulin pens easier to use, but they cost more than needles and syringes. You may want to consider using an insulin pen if you find it hard to fill the syringe while holding the vial or cannot read the markings on the syringe. Different pen types have features that can help with your injections. Some reusable pens have a memory function, which can recall dose amounts and timing. Other types of \u201cconnected\u201d insulin pens can be programmed to calculate insulin doses and provide downloadable data reports, which can help you and your doctor adjust your insulin doses. An insulin pump is a small machine that gives you steady doses of insulin throughout the day. You wear one type of pump outside your body on a belt or in a pocket or pouch. The insulin pump connects to a small plastic tube and a very small needle. You insert the plastic tube with a needle under your skin, then take out the needle. The plastic tube will stay inserted for several days while attached to the insulin pump. The machine pumps insulin through the tube into your body 24 hours a day and can be programmed to give you more or less insulin based on your needs. You can also give yourself doses of insulin through the pump at mealtimes. Another type of pump has no tubes. This pump attaches directly to your skin with a self-adhesive pad and is controlled by a hand-held device. The plastic tube and pump device are changed every several days. Another way to take insulin is by breathing powdered insulin into your mouth from an inhaler device. The insulin goes into your lungs and moves quickly into your blood. You may want to use an   to avoid using needles. Inhaled insulin is only for adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Taking insulin with an inhaler is less common than using a needle and syringe. A jet injector is a device that sends a fine spray of insulin into the skin at high pressure instead of using a needle to deliver the insulin. It is used less commonly than a needle and syringe or a pen. An artificial pancreas is a system of three devices that work together to mimic how a healthy pancreas controls blood glucose in the body. A  \u00a0tracks blood glucose levels every few minutes using a small sensor inserted under the skin that is held in place with an adhesive pad. The CGM wirelessly sends the information to a program on a smartphone or an insulin infusion pump. The program calculates how much insulin you need. The insulin infusion pump will adjust how much insulin is given from minute to minute to help keep your blood glucose level in your target range. An artificial pancreas is mainly used to help people with type 1 diabetes. You may need to take medicines to manage your type 2 diabetes, in addition to consuming healthy foods and beverages and being physically active. You can take many diabetes medicines by mouth. These medicines are called oral medicines. Most people with type 2 diabetes start with   pills. Metformin also comes as a liquid. Metformin helps your liver make less glucose and helps your body use insulin better. This drug may help you lose a small amount of weight. Other oral medicines act in different ways to lower blood glucose levels. Combining two or three kinds of diabetes medicines can lower blood glucose levels better than taking just one medicine. Read about different kinds of       from the FDA. \n If you have type 1 diabetes, your doctor may recommend you take other medicines, in addition to insulin, to help control your blood glucose. Some of these medicines work to slow how fast food and beverages move through your  . These medicines also slow down how quickly and how high your blood glucose levels rise after eating. Other medicines work to block certain  \u00a0in your  \u00a0that raise blood glucose levels after meals or help the kidneys to remove more glucose from your blood. Besides insulin,       are available that will keep your blood glucose level from rising too high after you eat or drink. These medicines, known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists,  may make you feel less hungry and help you lose some weight. GLP-1 medicines are not substitutes for insulin. Side effects are problems that result from taking a medicine. Some diabetes medicines can cause  , also called low blood glucose, if you don\u2019t balance your medicines with food and activity. Ask your doctor whether your diabetes medicine can cause hypoglycemia or other side effects, such as upset stomach and weight gain. Aim to take your diabetes medicines as your doctor instructs you, to help prevent side effects and diabetes problems. Ask your doctor these questions when you get a prescription for a medicine. You may want to make copies of this list and fill it out for each of your medicines. What are the names of my medicine? Brand name:______ Generic name:_____ What does my medicine do? When should I start this medicine? This medicine is prescribed by:_____ How long will this medicine take to work? What is the strength (for example, how many milligrams, written as mg)? How much should I take for each dose? How many times a day should I take my medicine? At what times should I take my medicine? Should I take it before, with, or after a meal? Should I avoid any foods or medicines when I take it? Should I avoid alcoholic beverages when I take it? Are there any times when I should change the amount of medicine I take? What should I do if I forget to take it? If I'm sick and can't keep food down, should I still take my medicine? Can my diabetes medicine cause low blood glucose? What should I do if my blood glucose is too low? What side effects can this medicine cause? What should I do if I have side effects? How should I store this medicine? If medicines and lifestyle changes are not enough to manage your diabetes, there are other treatments that might help you. These treatments include  \u00a0for certain people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, or  \u00a0for some people with type 1 diabetes. Weight-loss  \u00a0are operations that help you lose weight by making changes to your digestive system. Weight-loss surgery is also called bariatric\u00a0or metabolic surgery. This type of surgery may help some people who have obesity and type 2 diabetes lose a large amount of weight and bring their blood glucose levels back to a healthy range. How long the improved response lasts can vary by patient, type of weight-loss surgery, and the amount of weight the person lost. Other factors include how long a person had diabetes and whether the person used insulin. Some people with type 2 diabetes  . Researchers are studying whether weight-loss surgery can help control blood glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes who have obesity. Pancreatic islet transplantation is a treatment for type 1 diabetes in people who struggle to manage their blood glucose levels. Pancreatic  \u00a0are clusters of cells in the pancreas that make the hormone insulin. In type 1 diabetes, the body\u2019s immune system attacks these cells. A pancreatic islet transplantation replaces destroyed islets with new islets from a deceased donor. The new islets make and release insulin. The NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life. Clinical trials\u2014and other types of  \u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help health care professionals and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future. . Researchers are studying many aspects of diabetes medicines, including Watch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials. You can view a filtered list of clinical studies on insulin, medicines, and other diabetes treatments covered in this health topic that are federally funded, open, and recruiting at  \n . You can expand or narrow the list to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe.

You may want to get help from family, loved ones, friends, and other trusted people in your community. You can also get information from your health care professionals. What you choose to eat, how much you eat, and when you eat are parts of a meal plan. Having healthy foods and drinks can help keep your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels in the ranges your health care professional recommends. If you have overweight or obesity, a healthy meal plan\u2014along with regular physical activity, getting enough sleep, and other healthy behaviors\u2014may help you reach and maintain a healthy weight.

Doctors use a variety of tests to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes. Your doctor may recommend different tests depending on whether you have symptoms or not, or whether you are pregnant. The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test measures your blood glucose level at a single point in time. For the most reliable results, your doctor will give you the test in the morning after you have fasted for at least 8 hours. Fasting means having nothing to eat or drink except sips of water. The  \u00a0is a blood test that provides your average levels of blood glucose over the last 3 months. Other names for the A1C test are hemoglobin A1C, HbA1C, glycated hemoglobin, and glycosylated hemoglobin test. You can eat and drink before this test. Before using the A1C test to diagnose diabetes, your doctor will consider factors, such as whether you are in your second or third trimester of pregnancy or whether you have certain types of   or another problem with your blood.  The A1C test might not be accurate in those cases. Certain types of  , called hemoglobin variants, can interfere with measuring A1C levels. Most A1C tests used in the United States are not affected by the most common variants. If your A1C test results and blood glucose levels do not match, your doctor should consider that the A1C test may not be a reliable test for you. Your doctor will report your A1C test result as a percentage, such as an A1C of 7%. The higher the percentage is, the higher your average blood glucose levels are. Sometimes doctors use the random plasma glucose test to diagnose diabetes when you have symptoms of diabetes and they do not want to wait until you have fasted for 8 hours. You may have this blood test at any time. If you are pregnant, your doctor might test you for gestational diabetes with the glucose challenge test. Another name for this test is the glucose screening test. In this test, a health care professional will take a sample of your blood 1 hour after you drink a sweet liquid containing glucose. You do not need to fast for this test. If your blood glucose level is too high\u2014135 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL or higher\u2014you may need to return for an oral glucose tolerance test while fasting. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) helps doctors detect type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes. However, the OGTT is a more expensive test than the FPG test and the glucose challenge test, and it is not as easy to give. Before the test, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours. A health care professional will take a blood sample to measure your glucose level after fasting. Next, you will drink a liquid that is high in sugar. Another blood sample is taken 2 hours later to check your blood glucose level. If your blood glucose level is high, you may have diabetes. If you are pregnant, your blood will be drawn every hour for 2 to 3 hours. If your blood glucose levels are high two or more times during the OGTT, you may have gestational diabetes. Each test to detect diabetes and prediabetes uses a different measurement. Usually, your doctor will use a second test to confirm you have diabetes. The table below helps you understand what your test results mean if you are not pregnant.  If you are pregnant, some tests use different cutoffs. Ask your doctor what your test results mean. * 2 hours after glucose intake \n\u2021 Used when there are symptoms \nSource: American Diabetes Association Even though the tests described above can confirm you have diabetes, they can\u2019t identify what type you have\u2014type 1, type 2, or a rare type of diabetes called monogenic diabetes. Treatment can depend on the type of diabetes you have, so knowing which type you have is important. Genetic testing can diagnose most forms of  , which is caused by a change\u2014or mutation\u2014in a gene. Anyone can have monogenic diabetes, but it is more common in babies who develop diabetes before they are 6 months old, some teens, and some young adults. If you have diabetes, your doctor may look for certain autoantibodies to see if your diabetes is type 1. Autoantibodies are proteins in your  \u00a0that mistakenly attack your healthy tissues and cells. A health care professional will take a sample of your blood for this test. If autoantibodies for diabetes are found in your blood, you may have type 1 diabetes. If you do not have diabetes but your parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes, your doctor might give you this test to see if you have a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes.

Different types of nerve damage cause different symptoms. Symptoms can range from pain and numbness in your feet to problems with the functions of your internal organs, such as your heart and bladder. Diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage that is caused by diabetes. Over time, high blood glucose levels, also called blood sugar, and high levels of fats, such as triglycerides, in the blood from diabetes can damage your nerves. Symptoms depend on which type of diabetic neuropathy you have. Peripheral neuropathy is a type of nerve damage that typically affects the feet and legs and sometimes affects the hands and arms. This type of neuropathy is very common. About one-third to one-half of people with diabetes have peripheral neuropathy. Autonomic neuropathy is damage to nerves that control your internal organs, leading to problems with your heart rate and blood pressure, digestive system, bladder, sex organs, sweat glands, and eyes. The damage can also lead to hypoglycemia unawareness.  Focal neuropathies are conditions in which you typically have damage to single nerves, most often in your hand, head, torso, or leg. The most common types of focal neuropathy are entrapment syndromes, such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Other types of focal neuropathy are much less common. Proximal neuropathy is a rare and disabling type of nerve damage in your hip, buttock, or thigh. The damage typically affects one side of your body and may rarely spread to the other side. Symptoms gradually improve over a period of months or years.

For many people with  , this means a blood glucose reading lower than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).  Your number might be different, so check with your doctor or health care team to find out what blood glucose level is low for you. Low blood glucose is common among people with  \u00a0and among people with  \u00a0who take  \u00a0or some other  . In a large global study of people with diabetes who take insulin, 4 in 5 people with type 1 diabetes and nearly half of those with type 2 diabetes reported a low blood sugar event at least once over a 4-week period. Severely low blood glucose, defined as when your blood glucose level drops so low you can\u2019t treat it yourself, is less common. Among U.S. adults with diabetes who take insulin or some diabetes medicines that help the  \u00a0release insulin into the blood, 2 in 100 may develop severely low blood glucose each year. You are more likely to develop low blood glucose if you Symptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly and can vary from person to person. As Table 1 below shows, symptoms can range from mild to severe. If your blood glucose level is low, you may feel If your blood glucose level is very low, your brain may stop working as it should. You may Your blood glucose level can drop while you sleep and stay low for several hours, causing serious problems.  Symptoms of low blood glucose while you sleep can include Although you may not wake up or notice any symptoms, low blood glucose can interfere with your sleep, which may affect your quality of life, mood, and ability to work. Having low blood glucose during sleep can also make you less likely to notice and respond to symptoms of low blood glucose during the day. Mild-to-moderate low blood glucose can be easily treated. But severely low blood glucose can cause serious complications, including passing out, coma, or death. Repeated episodes of low blood glucose can lead to Low blood glucose levels can be a side effect of insulin or some other medicines that help your pancreas release insulin into your blood. Taking these can lower your blood glucose level. Two types of diabetes pills can cause low blood glucose The following may also lower your blood glucose level If you take insulin or other medicines that lower blood glucose, the following actions may help you prevent low blood glucose levels. If you begin to feel one or more symptoms of low blood glucose, check your blood glucose level. If your blood glucose level is below your target or less than 70 mg/dL, follow these steps Some diabetes medicines slow down the digestion of carbohydrates to keep blood glucose levels from rising too high after you eat. If you develop low blood glucose while taking these medicines, you will need to take glucose tablets or glucose gel right away. Eating or drinking other sources of carbohydrates won\u2019t raise your blood glucose level quickly enough. \u2014a hormone that raises blood glucose levels\u2014is the best way to treat severely low blood glucose. Available as an injection or a nasal spray, glucagon will quickly raise your blood glucose level. Your doctor can prescribe you a glucagon kit for use in case of an emergency. If your blood glucose level drops very low, you won\u2019t be able to treat it by yourself. Be prepared to address severely low blood glucose by The NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life. Clinical trials\u2014and other types of  \u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you.

Researchers have found variants in more than 20 genes that cause monogenic diabetes.  Monogenic forms of diabetes are part of the group of atypical diabetes. People with atypical forms of diabetes have symptoms and signs that are different than those of   or   diabetes. If you have monogenic diabetes, you may have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Diabetes may raise your risk of eye,  , nerve, and heart damage. Diabetes is also linked to some types of cancer. You may be able to prevent or delay   by  . Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) are the two main forms of monogenic diabetes. MODY forms of diabetes usually develop in teens or young adults. People with some forms of MODY have blood glucose levels that are only a little higher than normal and do not change much during their lives. The levels of blood glucose are typically not high enough to damage their organs, so they may not need treatment. However, people with other forms of MODY have higher blood glucose levels and need treatment. NDM forms of diabetes develop in the first 6 to 12 months of life.  Babies with forms of NDM do not produce enough  , which allows their blood glucose levels to go up more than normal. Babies who develop diabetes in the first 6 months of life almost always have a form of NDM. In most forms of NDM, babies will have lifelong diabetes. These forms of NDM are called permanent NDM. Babies with some forms of NDM have diabetes as infants, but their diabetes goes away during childhood. For these babies, diabetes often shows up again later in life. These forms of NDM are called transient NDM. Some research, mainly from the United States and Europe, has found that People with monogenic diabetes may be misdiagnosed with   or   diabetes because the symptoms may be similar. Therefore, it is difficult to know how many people have monogenic diabetes. People with MODY forms of diabetes usually have other family members with diabetes. MODY forms of diabetes most often occur in people ages 30 or younger.  Forms of NDM most often occur in babies ages 6 months or younger. More studies are needed to understand which populations, based on race, are more affected by forms of MODY and NDM. Some people with forms of monogenic diabetes may develop the same diabetes  \u00a0as people with other types of diabetes. High blood glucose levels from diabetes can damage every part of your body, including your If you have a form of monogenic diabetes, work with your primary health care professional, who may be a doctor, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner, to manage your diabetes. Your health care team can help you lower your chances of developing other health problems. The symptoms of monogenic diabetes depend on which gene variant you have. Some people have no symptoms. Other people may have general symptoms of diabetes that include A variant, or change, in a single gene causes monogenic diabetes. You inherited genes\u2014which determine things like your hair color, eye color, and height\u2014from each of your parents. In most cases of MODY forms of diabetes, you inherit a gene from one or both parents that causes the disease. Babies with NDM forms of diabetes rarely have a family history of the disease. Most cases of NDM are caused by a gene change that happens while a baby develops in the womb. Most people with MODY forms of diabetes have inherited a gene for the disease from a parent who also had the disease. Diseases caused by a gene from one parent are called  . If you have a form of NDM or MODY that is autosomal dominant, your child has a 50% chance of having the disease. Some forms of NDM or MODY occur only if a child inherits a gene for the disease from both parents. In most cases, neither of the child\u2019s parents had the disease. Diseases that occur only if you inherit a gene from both parents who don\u2019t have the disease are called  . If you inherit a gene for a recessive form of NDM or MODY from only one parent, you won\u2019t have the disease. However, you can pass that gene to future generations. Different gene variants cause monogenic diabetes in different ways. For example, gene variants may Your health care professional will usually test you for forms of monogenic diabetes if you have diabetes, are younger than 30 years old, don\u2019t have  , and have family members with these forms of diabetes. Health care professionals will diagnose diabetes using your symptoms, medical and family history, and  . Your health care professional may also order tests to find out if your diabetes is type 1, type 2, or monogenic. The type of diabetes you have will help your health care professional determine how to treat the disease. Health care professionals can diagnose diabetes using blood tests that measure your glucose level to see if it is higher than normal. People with some forms of monogenic diabetes have blood glucose levels that are a little higher than normal. Blood glucose tests can help your health care professional tell if you have diabetes. However, these tests do not show the type of diabetes you have. Your health care professional will order a test for autoantibodies to find out if you have type 1 diabetes. Autoantibodies are proteins made by your  \u00a0that attack your healthy tissues and cells by mistake. In rare cases, people with monogenic diabetes may also have autoantibodies in their blood.  looks for gene variants. Health care professionals use genetic tests to diagnose monogenic diabetes. Health care professionals may request a genetic test for If you, your partner, or family members have monogenic diabetes, you may want to consider  . Genetic counseling can help you decide if you should get tested for monogenic diabetes. Genetic counseling can also help you understand the risk of your children developing this disease. Talk with your health care professional for more information about how genetic counseling could help you, what it may cost, and whether it\u2019s covered by your insurance. How you manage monogenic diabetes will depend on the specific gene variant you have. Your health care professional and diabetes care team will work with you to develop a plan to  .

People who take insulin to manage their diabetes may benefit from using a  \u00a0(CGM). A CGM uses a sensor in the tissue under your skin and shows changes in glucose levels throughout the day and night. Many CGM systems have alarms and warnings that let you know if your glucose level is too low or too high. For safety, you may sometimes need to compare your CGM glucose readings with results from a standard blood glucose meter.

Ask your health care team about the best way to check your blood glucose level and how often you should check it. Make sure to keep a record of your blood glucose self-checks, including the date and time you checked it, the results, and other information, such as what you ate or what physical activity you did that day. You can use a chart or a smartphone app to help you keep track. Take this information with you when you visit your health care team. Talk with your health care team about the blood glucose range that is healthy for you. Be sure to tell your health care team if your glucose levels frequently go above or below your target range. Many people with diabetes aim to keep their blood glucose at these levels Your blood glucose goals may be different if you are an adult over age 65 and have had diabetes for a long time. Your blood glucose goals may also be different if you have other health problems, like heart disease, or if your blood glucose often gets too low. If you use a CGM, your health care team may ask you to keep track of your time in range. Time in range is the percentage of time that your glucose level stays in your target range. For many people with diabetes, the target range is between 70 and 180 mg/dL. Your health care team may adjust your diabetes care plan to help you stay in your target range at least 70% of the time. When your blood glucose level is too low, it is called  . For most people with diabetes, the blood glucose level is too low when it is below 70 mg/dL.

Ask your health care team if you should adjust your meal plan, activity level, or medicines in special situations, such as when you are  , fasting, at  , planning to  , or experiencing an  . You are the most important member of your health care team, but working with your health care team may help you improve your self-care. Most people with diabetes get help from a primary care professional, such as an internal medicine doctor, family doctor, pediatrician, physician assistant, or certified nurse practitioner trained in diabetes care. Ask your primary care professional about adding other members to your team, including Write a   before your visit with a health care professional so you don\u2019t forget what you want to ask. NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and improve quality of life. Clinical trials\u2014and other types of  \u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help health care professionals and researchers learn more about diseases and improve health care for people in the future. Researchers are studying many aspects of managing diabetes, such as .  Watch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials. You can view a filtered list of clinical studies on managing diabetes that are federally funded, open, and recruiting at  . You can expand or narrow the list to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe for you. Always talk with your primary health care professional before you participate in a clinical study. The research funded by NIDDK has improved quality of life for people with diabetes by finding better ways to diagnose and treat the disease. For decades, NIDDK has supported  \u00a0used by some people who need insulin to manage their diabetes. NIDDK supported research that helped scientists develop the first continuous glucose monitor (CGM) that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999. CGMs, which are part of artificial pancreas systems, help people track glucose levels in real-time with fewer finger pricks. Another major milestone came in 2016, when the FDA approved a commercial \u201chybrid\u201d artificial pancreas system. Other artificial pancreas systems have been approved since 2016. NIDDK continues to support research into artificial pancreas systems and other technologies that may improve diabetes management. NIDDK funded the landmark  . The study showed that participants with type 1 diabetes who kept their blood glucose levels close to normal greatly lowered their chances of developing eye, kidney, and nerve disease. A follow-up study, the ongoing  , has continued to follow DCCT participants since 1994. EDIC has shown that there are long-term benefits of early and intensive blood glucose management on slowing or preventing the development of health problems such as heart, eye, kidney, and nerve diseases. Findings from the DCCT and EDIC studies changed the way diabetes is treated worldwide, and they show that blood glucose control can help people with diabetes lead longer and healthier lives. NIDDK also funded the Diabetes & Aging Study to research the effects of early blood glucose management and the development of diabetes health problems in people with type 2 diabetes. The study found that people with less effective diabetes management during the first year after being diagnosed with diabetes had a higher risk of diabetes complications and death. The   and a follow-up study, TODAY2, found that type 2 diabetes can be more difficult to treat and manage when it occurs in younger people. The TODAY studies, both funded by NIDDK, show the importance of early, intensive treatment and blood glucose management for children or adolescents diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

Gestational diabetes can cause health problems in both mother and baby. Managing your diabetes can help protect you and your baby. Gestational diabetes often has no symptoms, or they may be mild, such as being thirstier than normal or having to urinate more often. Gestational diabetes is sometimes related to the hormonal changes of pregnancy that make your body less able to use insulin. Genes and extra weight may also play a role. Your doctor will test you for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. Tests include the glucose challenge test and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). If the results of the glucose challenge test show high blood glucose, you will return for an OGTT test to confirm the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Managing gestational diabetes includes following a healthy eating plan and being physically active. If your eating plan and physical activity aren\u2019t enough to keep your blood glucose in your target range, you may need insulin. You can lower your chance of getting gestational diabetes by losing extra weight before you get pregnant if you are overweight. Being physically active before and during pregnancy also may help prevent gestational diabetes. If you had gestational diabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Your child is more likely to have obesity or develop type 2 diabetes. You may be able to lower your and your child\u2019s chances of developing these problems by reaching a healthy weight, making healthy food choices, and being physically active.

These conditions include diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, cataracts, and glaucoma. Over time, diabetes can cause damage to your eyes that can lead to poor vision or even blindness. But you can take steps to prevent diabetic eye disease, or keep it from getting worse, by taking care of your diabetes. The best ways to manage your diabetes and keep your eyes healthy are to Often, there are no warning signs of diabetic eye disease or vision loss when damage first develops. A full, dilated eye exam helps your doctor find and treat eye problems early\u2014often before much vision loss can occur. Diabetes affects your eyes when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high.  you are not likely to have vision loss from high blood glucose. People sometimes have blurry vision for a few days or weeks when they\u2019re changing their diabetes care plan or medicines. High glucose can change fluid levels or cause swelling in the   that help you to focus, causing blurred vision. This type of blurry vision is temporary and goes away when your glucose level gets closer to normal.  it can damage the tiny   in the back of your eyes. This damage can begin during  , when blood glucose is higher than normal, but not high enough for you to be diagnosed with diabetes. Damaged blood vessels may leak fluid and cause swelling. New, weak blood vessels may also begin to grow.  These blood vessels can bleed into the middle part of the eye, lead to scarring, or cause dangerously high pressure inside your eye. Most serious diabetic eye diseases begin with blood vessel problems. The four eye diseases that can threaten your sight are The   is the inner lining at the back of each eye. The retina senses light and turns it into signals that your brain decodes, so you can see the world around you. Damaged blood vessels can harm the retina, causing a disease called diabetic retinopathy. In early diabetic retinopathy, blood vessels can weaken, bulge, or leak into the retina. This stage is called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. If the disease gets worse, some blood vessels close off, which causes new blood vessels to grow, or proliferate, on the surface of the retina. This stage is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These abnormal new blood vessels can lead to serious vision problems. The part of your retina that you need for reading, driving, and seeing faces is called the  . Diabetes can lead to swelling in the macula, which is called diabetic macular edema. Over time, this disease can destroy the sharp vision in this part of the eye, leading to partial vision loss or blindness. Macular edema usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy. Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve\u2014the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain. Diabetes doubles the chances of having glaucoma, which can lead to vision loss and blindness if not treated early. Symptoms depend on which type of glaucoma you have.  . The lenses within our eyes are clear structures that help provide sharp vision\u2014but they tend to become cloudy as we age. People with diabetes are more likely to develop cloudy lenses, called  . People with diabetes can develop cataracts at an earlier age than people without diabetes. Researchers think that high glucose levels cause deposits to build up in the lenses of your eyes. About one in three people with diabetes who are older than age 40 already have some signs of diabetic retinopathy.  Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss in people with diabetes. Each person\u2019s outlook for the future, however, depends in large part on regular care. Finding and treating diabetic retinopathy early can reduce the risk of blindness by 95 percent. Your chances of developing glaucoma or cataracts are about twice that of someone without diabetes. Anyone with diabetes can develop diabetic eye disease. Your risk is greater with High blood cholesterol and smoking may also raise your risk for diabetic eye disease. Some groups are affected more than others. African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Hispanics/Latinos, Pacific Islanders, and older adults are at greater risk of losing vision or going blind from diabetes. If you have diabetes and become pregnant, you can develop eye problems very quickly during your pregnancy. If you already have some diabetic retinopathy, it can get worse during pregnancy. Changes that help your body support a growing baby may put stress on the blood vessels in your eyes. Your health care team will suggest regular eye exams during pregnancy to catch and treat problems early and protect your vision. Diabetes that occurs only during pregnancy, called  , does not usually cause eye problems. Researchers aren't sure why this is the case. Your chances of developing diabetic eye disease increase the longer you have diabetes. Often there are no early symptoms of diabetic eye disease. You may have no pain and no change in your vision as damage begins to grow inside your eyes, particularly with diabetic retinopathy. When symptoms do occur, they may include Talk with your eye doctor if you have any of these symptoms. Call a doctor right away if you notice sudden changes to your vision, including flashes of light or many more spots (floaters) than usual. You also should see a doctor right away if it looks like a curtain is pulled over your eyes. These changes in your sight can be symptoms of a  , which is a medical emergency. Having a full, dilated eye exam is the best way to check for eye problems from diabetes. Your doctor will place drops in your eyes to widen your pupils. This allows the doctor to examine a larger area at the back of each eye, using a special magnifying lens. Your vision will be blurry for a few hours after a dilated exam. Your doctor will also Your doctor may suggest other tests, too, depending on your health history. Most people with diabetes should see an eye care professional once a year for a complete eye exam. Your own health care team may suggest a different plan, based on your type of diabetes and the time since you were first diagnosed. Women who develop gestational diabetes don\u2019t usually need an eye exam because they don\u2019t develop diabetic eye disease during pregnancy. If you have any questions, ask your doctor. Your doctor may recommend having eye exams more often than once a year, along with management of your diabetes. This means managing your diabetes ABCs, which include your A1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol; and quitting smoking. Ask your health care team what you can do to reach your goals. Doctors may treat   with medicine, laser treatments, surgery, or a combination of these options. Your doctor may treat your eyes with anti-VEGF medicine, such as aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab. These medicines block the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye. Anti-VEGF medicines can also stop fluid leaks, which can help treat  . The doctor will inject an anti-VEGF medicine into your eyes during office visits. You'll have several treatments during the first few months, then fewer treatments after you finish the first round of therapy. Your doctor will use medicine to numb your eyes so you don\u2019t feel pain. The needle is about the thickness of a human hair. Anti-VEGF treatments can stop further vision loss and may improve vision in some people. Laser treatment, also called photocoagulation, creates tiny burns inside the eye with a beam of light. This method treats leaky blood vessels and extra fluid, called edema. Your doctor usually provides this treatment during several office visits, using medicine to numb your eyes. Laser treatment can keep eye disease from getting worse, which is important to prevent vision loss or blindness. But laser treatment is less likely to bring back vision you\u2019ve already lost compared with anti-VEGF medicines. There are two types of  : Vitrectomy is a surgery to remove the clear gel that fills the center of the eye, called the vitreous gel. The procedure treats problems with severe bleeding or scar tissue caused by proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Scar tissue can force the retina to peel away from the tissue beneath it, like wallpaper peeling away from a wall. A retina that comes completely loose, or detaches, can cause blindness. During vitrectomy, a clear salt solution is gently pumped into the eye to maintain eye pressure during surgery and to replace the removed vitreous. Vitrectomy is done in a surgery center or hospital with pain medicine. In a surgery center or hospital visit, your doctor can remove the cloudy lens in your eye, where the cataract has grown, and replace it with an artificial lens. People who have cataract surgery generally have better vision afterward. After your eye heals, you may need a new prescription for your glasses. Your vision following cataract surgery may also depend on treating any damage from diabetic retinopathy or macular edema. To prevent diabetic eye disease, or to keep it from getting worse, manage your diabetes ABCs: your A1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol; and quit smoking if you smoke. Read more information on how to  . Also, have a   at least once a year\u2014or more often if recommended by your eye care professional. These actions are powerful ways to protect the health of your eyes\u2014and can prevent blindness. The sooner you work to manage your diabetes and other health conditions, the better. And, even if you\u2019ve struggled in the past to manage your health, taking better care of yourself now can protect your eyes for the future. It\u2019s never too late to begin. Ask your eye care professional to help you find a   and rehabilitation clinic. Special eye care professionals can help you manage vision loss that cannot be corrected with glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery. Special devices and training may help you make the most of your remaining vision so that you can continue to be active, enjoy hobbies, visit friends and family members, and live without help from others.

People with diabetes are more likely to have  , cavities, and other problems with their teeth and gums.  And some of these mouth problems can make your diabetes worse. Taking good care of your teeth and gums, including getting regular cleanings and needed treatments, will help you prevent these problems or stop them from getting worse. Keeping your mouth healthy will also make it easier for you to  \u00a0and prevent diabetes-related health problems, such as  \u00a0and  . Diabetes can affect your mouth by changing your  \u2014the fluid that keeps your mouth wet. Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by washing away pieces of food, preventing  \u00a0from growing, and fighting the acids produced by bacteria. Saliva also has minerals that help protect tissues in your mouth and fight tooth decay. Diabetes and some  \u00a0can cause the salivary glands in your mouth to make less saliva. When less saliva flows, the risk for dental cavities, gum disease, and other mouth problems increases. Diabetes can also increase the amount of  \u00a0in your saliva. Diabetes occurs when your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar, is too high. High levels of glucose in your blood can also cause glucose to build up in your saliva. This glucose can feed harmful bacteria that combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque, which causes cavities. If you don\u2019t remove plaque, it can also build up on your teeth near your gum line and harden into a deposit called tartar, which can cause gum disease. Untreated, these mouth problems can lead to tooth loss. Almost 25% of U.S. adults with diabetes ages 50 and older have severe tooth loss, compared with about 16% of those without diabetes. , also called periodontal gum disease, is the most common and serious mouth problem related to diabetes. Untreated, the disease advances in stages, from inflamed gums to tooth loss. High levels of blood glucose increase the risk that gum disease will progress from mild to severe. The first stage of gum disease is gingivitis, a mild inflammation of the soft tissues around your teeth. Gingivitis develops when plaque and tartar build up on your teeth near your gum line, irritating and inflaming your gums. As a result, your gums may become red and swollen, and may bleed easily. Untreated, gingivitis can progress to periodontitis, an infection of the gums and bone that hold your teeth in place. Your gums may pull away from your teeth, forming pockets that slowly become infected. The bacteria in your mouth and your body\u2019s response to the infection start to break down the bone and tissue that hold your teeth in place. If periodontitis is not treated, the teeth can become loose and may even need to be removed. In addition to gum disease, diabetes also increases your risk for These mouth problems, as well as tooth loss, can make it harder for you to follow a  \u00a0that will help you manage your diabetes. Check your mouth for signs and symptoms of problems from diabetes, such as See your dentist right away if you notice any signs or symptoms of mouth problems. Your dentist is an important ally in keeping your mouth healthy and treating mouth problems before they become serious. If you have diabetes If you feel nervous about visiting the dentist, tell your dentist and the staff about your feelings. Your dentist can adapt the treatment to your needs. High blood glucose increases the risk for infections after mouth surgery and can also take your mouth longer to heal. Tell your doctor if you will be having oral surgery or other extensive dental work.

Insulin is a   made by the   that helps   in your blood enter cells in your muscle, fat, and liver, where it\u2019s used for energy. Glucose comes from the food you eat. The liver also makes glucose in times of need, such as when you\u2019re fasting. When blood glucose, also called blood sugar, levels rise after you eat, your pancreas releases insulin into the blood. Insulin then lowers blood glucose to keep it in the normal range. Insulin resistance is when cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don\u2019t respond well to insulin and can\u2019t easily take up glucose from your blood. As a result, your pancreas makes more insulin to help glucose enter your cells. As long as your pancreas can make enough insulin to overcome your cells\u2019 weak response to insulin, your blood glucose levels will stay in the healthy range. Prediabetes means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. Prediabetes usually occurs in people who already have some insulin resistance or whose   in the pancreas aren\u2019t making enough insulin to keep blood glucose in the normal range. Without enough insulin, extra glucose stays in your bloodstream rather than entering your cells. Over time, you could develop  . More than 84 million people ages 18 and older have prediabetes in the United States.  That\u2019s about 1 out of every 3 adults. People who have   or lifestyle risk factors are more likely to develop insulin resistance or prediabetes. Risk factors include People who have metabolic syndrome\u2014a combination of high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, and large waist size\u2014are more likely to have prediabetes. Along with these risk factors, other things that may contribute to insulin resistance include Although you can\u2019t change risk factors such as family history, age, or ethnicity, you can change lifestyle risk factors around eating, physical activity, and weight. These lifestyle changes can lower your chances of developing insulin resistance or prediabetes. Researchers don\u2019t fully understand what causes insulin resistance and prediabetes, but they think excess weight and lack of physical activity are major factors. Experts believe  , especially too much fat in the   and around the organs, called visceral fat, is a main cause of insulin resistance. A waist measurement of 40 inches or more for men and 35 inches or more for women is linked to insulin resistance. This is true even if your   (BMI) falls within the normal range. However, research has shown that Asian Americans may have an increased risk for insulin resistance even without a high BMI. Researchers used to think that fat tissue was only for energy storage. However, studies have shown that belly fat makes hormones and other substances that can contribute to chronic, or long-lasting,   in the body. Inflammation may play a role in insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and  . Excess weight may lead to insulin resistance, which in turn may play a part in the development of  . Not getting enough physical activity is linked to insulin resistance and prediabetes. Regular physical activity causes changes in your body that make it better able to keep your blood glucose levels in balance. Insulin resistance and prediabetes usually have no symptoms. Some people with prediabetes may have darkened skin in the armpit or on the back and sides of the neck, a condition called acanthosis nigricans. Many small skin growths called skin tags often appear in these same areas. Even though blood glucose levels are not high enough to cause symptoms for most people, a few research studies have shown that some people with prediabetes may already have early changes in their eyes that can lead to  . This problem more often occurs in people with diabetes. Doctors use   to find out if someone has prediabetes, but they don\u2019t usually test for insulin resistance. The most accurate test for insulin resistance is complicated and used mostly for research. Doctors most often use the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test or the A1C test to diagnose prediabetes. Less often, doctors use the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is more expensive and not as easy to give. The   reflects your average blood glucose over the past 3 months. The FPG and OGTT show your blood glucose level at the time of the test.  The A1C test is not as sensitive as the other tests. In some people, it may miss prediabetes that the OGTT could catch. The OGTT can identify how your body handles glucose after a meal\u2014often before your fasting blood glucose level becomes abnormal. Often doctors use the OGTT to check for gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. People with prediabetes have up to a 50 percent chance of developing diabetes over the next 5 to 10 years. You can take steps to manage your prediabetes and  . The following test results show Prediabetes You should be tested for prediabetes if you are overweight or have obesity and have one or more other risk factors for diabetes, or if your parents, siblings, or children have type 2 diabetes. Even if you don\u2019t have risk factors, you should start getting tested once you reach age 45. If the results are normal but you have other risk factors for diabetes, you should be retested at least every 3 years. Physical activity and losing weight if you need to may help your body respond better to insulin. Taking small steps, such as eating   and moving more to lose weight, can help reverse insulin resistance and prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes. The National Institutes of Health-funded research study, the   (DPP), showed that for people at high risk of developing diabetes, losing 5 to 7 percent of their starting weight helped reduce their chance of developing the disease.  That\u2019s 10 to 14 pounds for someone who weighs 200 pounds. People in the study lost weight by changing their diet and being more physically active. The DPP also showed that taking  , a medicine used to treat diabetes, could delay diabetes. Metformin worked best for women with a history of gestational diabetes, younger adults, and people with obesity. Ask your doctor if metformin might be right for you. , tracking your progress, and getting support from your health care professional, family, and friends can help you make lifestyle changes that may prevent or reverse insulin resistance and prediabetes.

Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes mainly from the food you eat.  , a   made by the  , helps the glucose in your blood get into your cells to be used for energy. Another hormone,  , works with insulin to control blood glucose levels. In most people with type 1 diabetes, the body\u2019s  , which normally fights infection, attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. As a result, your pancreas stops making insulin. Without insulin, glucose can\u2019t get into your cells and your blood glucose rises above normal. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive. Type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. Having a parent or sibling with the disease may increase your chance of developing type 1 diabetes. In the United States, about 5 percent of people with diabetes have type 1. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes are serious and usually happen quickly, over a few days to weeks. Symptoms can include Sometimes the first symptoms of type 1 diabetes are signs of a life-threatening condition called  . Some symptoms of DKA include DKA is serious and dangerous. If you or your child have symptoms of DKA, contact your health care professional right away, or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. Experts think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and factors in the environment, such as  , that might trigger the disease. Researchers are working to pinpoint the causes of type 1 diabetes through studies such as  . Health care professionals usually test people for type 1 diabetes if they have clear-cut diabetes symptoms. Health care professionals most often use the   (RPG) test to diagnose type 1 diabetes. This blood test measures your blood glucose level at a single point in time. Sometimes health professionals also use the   to find out how long someone has had high blood glucose. Even though these tests can confirm that you have diabetes, they can\u2019t identify what type you have. Treatment depends on the type of diabetes, so knowing whether you have type 1 or type 2 is important. To find out if your diabetes is type 1, your health care professional may test your blood for certain autoantibodies. Autoantibodies are   that attack your healthy tissues and cells by mistake. The presence of certain types of autoantibodies is common in type 1 but not in type 2 diabetes. Because type 1 diabetes can run in families, your health care professional can test your family members for autoantibodies. Type 1 diabetes TrialNet, an international research network, also offers   of people diagnosed with the disease. The presence of autoantibodies, even without diabetes symptoms, means the family member is more likely to develop type 1 diabetes. If you have a brother or sister, child, or parent with type 1 diabetes, you may want to get an autoantibody test. People age 20 or younger who have a cousin, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, grandparent, or half-sibling with type 1 diabetes also may want to get tested. If you have type 1 diabetes, you must take insulin because your body no longer makes this hormone. Different   start to work at different speeds, and the effects of each last a different length of time. You may need to use more than one type. You can  . Common options include a needle and  ,  , or  . Some people who have trouble reaching their blood glucose targets with insulin alone also might need to take another type of diabetes medicine that works with insulin, such as  . Pramlintide, given by injection, helps keep blood glucose levels from going too high after eating. Few people with type 1 diabetes take pramlintide, however. The NIH has recently funded a large research study to test use of pramlintide along with insulin and glucagon in people with type 1 diabetes. Another diabetes medicine, metformin, may help decrease the amount of insulin you need to take, but more studies are needed to confirm this. Reseachers are also studying other diabetes pills that people with type 1 diabetes might take along with insulin. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can occur if you take insulin but don\u2019t match your dose with your food or physical activity. Severe hypoglycemia can be dangerous and needs to be treated right away.   and how to prevent or treat it. Along with insulin and any other medicines you use, you can   by taking care of yourself each day. Following your diabetes meal plan, being physically active, and checking your blood glucose often are some of the ways you can take care of yourself. Work with your health care team to come up with a diabetes care plan that works for you. If you are  , try to get your blood glucose levels in your target range   you get pregnant. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has played an important role in developing \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d technology. An artificial pancreas replaces manual blood glucose testing and the use of insulin shots. A single system monitors blood glucose levels around the clock and provides insulin or a combination of insulin and glucagon automatically. The system can also be monitored remotely, for example by parents or medical staff. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a type of artificial pancreas system called a hybrid closed-loop system. This system tests your glucose level every 5 minutes throughout the day and night through a  , and automatically gives you the right amount of  , a long-acting insulin, through a separate insulin pump. You still need to manually adjust the amount of insulin the pump delivers at mealtimes and when you need a correction dose. You also will  need to test your blood with a glucose meter several times a day. Talk with your health care provider about whether this system might be right for you. The illustration below shows the parts of a type of artificial pancreas system. The continuous glucose monitor sends information through a software program called a control algorithm. Based on your glucose level, the algorithm tells the insulin pump how much insulin to deliver. The software program could be installed on the pump or another device such as a cell phone or computer. Starting in late 2016 and early 2017, the NIDDK has funded   on different types of artificial pancreas devices to better help people with type 1 diabetes manage their disease. The devices may also help people with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes. NIDDK also supported research into  \u2014a treatment for type 1 diabetes in people who struggle to manage their blood glucose levels. Pancreatic islets are clusters of cells in the pancreas that make the hormone insulin. In type 1 diabetes, the body\u2019s immune system attacks these cells. A pancreatic islet transplant replaces destroyed islets with new islets from a deceased donor. The new islets make and release insulin. Over time, high blood glucose leads to problems such as If you have type 1 diabetes, you can help   by managing your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and following your self-care plan. At this time, type 1 diabetes can\u2019t be prevented. However, through studies such as TrialNet, researchers are working to identify possible ways to prevent or slow down the disease.

You or your partner may have trouble having or enjoying sex. Or, you may leak urine or have trouble emptying your bladder normally.  and nerves can be damaged by the effects of high  , also called blood sugar. This damage can lead to sexual and bladder problems. Keeping your blood glucose levels in your target range is an important way to prevent damage to your blood vessels and nerves. Work with your health care team to  . These problems may be signs that you need to manage your diabetes in a different way. Remember, a healthy sex life and a healthy bladder can improve your quality of life, so take action now if you have concerns. Yes. Changes in sexual function or bladder habits may be a sign that you have diabetes. Nerve damage caused by diabetes, also called  , can damage parts of your body\u2014like your genitals or urinary tract. For example, men with diabetes may develop   10 to 15 years earlier than men without diabetes. Talk with a health care professional if you have any  , including sexual and bladder problems. See a health care professional for problems with sex or your bladder. These problems could be a sign that you need to manage your diabetes differently. You may find it embarrassing and difficult to talk about these things. However, remember that health care professionals are trained to speak with people about every kind of health problem. Everyone deserves to have healthy relationships and enjoy the activities they love. You\u2019re more likely to develop sexual or bladder problems if you have diabetes and Research also suggests that certain genes may make people more likely to develop diabetic neuropathy. Changes in your blood vessels, nerves,  , and emotional health during diabetes may make it more difficult for you to have satisfactory sex. Diabetes and its related challenges also may make it harder for you to have a child. You have ED if you\u2019re unable to get or keep an erection firm enough for satisfactory sexual intercourse. More than half of men with diabetes will get ED. Men who have diabetes are more than 3 times more likely to develop ED than men who do not have diabetes.    may help prevent and treat ED caused by nerve damage and   problems. A doctor can help treat ED with medicine or a change in your diabetes care plan. Rarely, diabetes can cause  , which is when part or all of your semen goes into your bladder instead of out of your penis during ejaculation. During retrograde ejaculation, semen enters your bladder, mixes with urine, and is safely urinated out. A urine sample after ejaculation can show if you have retrograde ejaculation. Some men with retrograde ejaculation may not ejaculate at all. Men with diabetes are more likely to have  , also called penile curvature, than men who don\u2019t have diabetes.  Men with Peyronie\u2019s disease have scar tissue, called a plaque, in the penis, making it curve when erect. Curves in the penis can make sexual intercourse painful or difficult. Some men with Peyronie\u2019s disease may have ED. Men\u2019s   levels naturally lower with age. However, lower-than-normal testosterone levels may be the cause of some men\u2019s ED, or can explain why some men often feel tired,  , or have a low sex drive. Men with diabetes, especially those who are older and overweight, are more likely to have  , or \u201clow T.\u201d  If your doctor thinks you might have low T, you will probably be asked to give a blood sample, and a health care professional will give you a physical exam. Your doctor may suggest treating your low testosterone with a prescription gel, injection, or patch. Several studies show that, along with good diabetes management, testosterone therapy can lessen a man\u2019s sexual problems.  However,   and may not be safe for all men. Talk with your doctor about testosterone therapy\u2019s side effects and whether it\u2019s right for you. Some studies show that men with diabetes can have problems with their sperm that make it harder to conceive. Your sperm could be slow or not move well, or your sperm may not be able to fertilize a woman\u2019s egg well.  Working closely with your partner and a health care professional trained in fertility issues may help. If you and your partner want to conceive a child, your doctor may treat retrograde ejaculation caused by diabetes with medicine or by changing your diabetes care plan. Or, talk with a urologist who is a fertility expert. He or she may be able to collect your sperm from your urine and then use it for  . Low sexual desire and response, vaginal dryness, and painful sex can be caused by nerve damage, reduced blood flow to the genitals, and hormonal changes. Other conditions can cause these problems, too, including  . If you notice a change in your sex life, talk with your health care team. A physical exam, which will include a  , and blood and urine tests may help your doctor find the cause of your problems. Low sexual desire and sexual response can include With diabetes, your body and mind will likely go through many changes. For example, both high and low blood glucose levels can affect how and if you become aroused. Or, you may find yourself more tired than usual or depressed and  , making you less interested in sex. Your health care team can help you make changes to your diabetes care plan so that you\u2018re back on track. Women who keep blood glucose levels in their target range are less likely to have nerve damage, which can lead to low sexual desire and response. Some women with diabetes say they have uncomfortable or painful sexual intercourse. The nerves that tell your vagina to lubricate during stimulation can become damaged by diabetes. A prescription or over-the-counter vaginal lubricant may help if you have vaginal dryness. Managing your blood glucose well over many weeks, months, and years can help prevent nerve damage. Women with diabetes are more likely to have  , because yeast organisms can grow more easily when your blood glucose levels are higher. Yeast infections can be uncomfortable or painful and prevent you from enjoying activities, including having sex. Although some yeast infections can be treated at home, talk with a health care professional first about your symptoms. Some symptoms of yeast infections are similar to other types of infections, including sexually transmitted diseases. If you have  , it\u2019s important to get your blood glucose levels close to your target range before you get pregnant. High blood glucose can harm your baby during the first weeks of pregnancy, even before you know you\u2019re pregnant. If you have diabetes and are already pregnant, see your doctor as soon as possible to make a plan to manage your diabetes. Working with your health care team and following your diabetes management plan can help you have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby. Health problems such as obesity and   (PCOS) that are linked to diabetes can make it harder to conceive a child. Talk with a health care professional, such as a gynecologist or a fertility specialist, if you\u2019re having problems conceiving a child. Diabetes can cause nerve damage to your  , causing bladder problems. Overweight and obesity also can increase bladder problems, such as  . Managing diabetes is an important part of preventing problems that can lead to excess urination. Your health care team may be able to help you manage your blood glucose levels and help you  , if needed. Doctors use blood and urine tests to diagnose bladder problems or conditions with similar symptoms. Doctors also may use   to see what kind of bladder problem you have. Some people with diabetes who regularly have high blood glucose levels may have to urinate too often, also called  . Even men and women with diabetes who manage their blood glucose levels within their target range sometimes feel the sudden urge to urinate, called  . This can happen at night, also.   may help reduce the symptoms of bladder control problems. You may find that diabetes causes you to no longer feel when your bladder is full. Many people with diabetes report that they have trouble \u201cgoing.\u201d Over time, having a too-full bladder can cause damage to your bladder muscles that push urine out. When these muscles don\u2019t work correctly, urine may stay in your bladder too long, also called  . Urinary retention can cause bladder infections, urine leaks, and the feeling that you always have to go.  People with diabetes are more likely to have other types of UI, such as  .  , obesity, and bladder infections, which are linked with diabetes, are often related to bladder control problems. Leaking urine can cause you to avoid activities you once enjoyed, including sex. If you\u2019re overweight, losing weight can help you have fewer leaks. Avoiding weight gain may prevent UI. Studies suggest that, as your   increases, you\u2019re more likely to leak.  If you\u2019re overweight or have obesity, talk with your doctor about  . Work with your health care team to help manage and prevent urine leaks. Bladder control problems are often treatable and are very common, even in people who don\u2019t have diabetes. You don\u2019t have to accept rushing to the bathroom all the time to avoid leaks. People with diabetes are more likely to have urinary tract infections, also called  , or  .

People with any type of diabetes can have these symptoms. Some other symptoms, and how quickly the symptoms develop, depend on the type of diabetes that you have. Talk with your primary health care professional about any symptoms you are having and ask if you should be  . Your primary health care professional may be a doctor, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. In addition to some of the common diabetes symptoms listed above, people with  \u00a0may also have an unexplained weight loss. Most people don\u2019t know they have type 1 diabetes until they develop diabetes symptoms. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop quickly, over a few days or weeks. Type 1 diabetes is often diagnosed in children and young adults, but it can begin at any age. Children with type 1 diabetes typically develop symptoms over a short period of time. Common symptoms of type diabetes in children include These symptoms are less common in adults with type 1 diabetes. For some adults, symptoms of type 1 diabetes may develop slowly and seem more like  . Some adults who develop diabetes may need special tests to find out what type of diabetes they have. Talk with your health care professional about the type of diabetes you may have. They can help you understand its causes and treatments. Sometimes, people find out they have type 1 diabetes when they have signs and symptoms of a condition called  . Symptoms of DKA may include If you have type 1 diabetes, your body doesn\u2019t have enough  \u00a0to use blood glucose\u2014also called blood sugar\u2014for energy. Your body will begin to use  \u00a0as a source of energy instead. This process produces substances called  . High levels of ketones can cause DKA, which is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away. DKA usually affects people with type 1 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes may also develop DKA if their body doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can develop slowly, over several years. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms, or symptoms can be so mild that people might not even notice them. In addition to the common symptoms of diabetes listed above, people may find out they have type 2 diabetes when they develop symptoms of other  . These include  is a type of diabetes that may develop when you are pregnant. Most people with this type of diabetes have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms of gestational diabetes, they may be mild, such as being thirstier than usual or having to  \u00a0more often. People with a history of gestational diabetes are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. If you have a history of gestational diabetes, your health care professional may recommend regular testing for type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes develops when the body\u2019s   destroys the cells in the  \u00a0that make insulin. These cells are called beta cells. Genes and factors in the environment\u2014the places where people live, play, work, study, and gather\u2014may trigger the immune system to destroy beta cells in type 1 diabetes. Insulin is a  \u00a0that helps blood glucose get into the body\u2019s cells to be used as energy. When your body doesn\u2019t have enough insulin, glucose in your blood can\u2019t get into the cells. As a result, your cells lack energy, your blood glucose level rises, and you develop diabetes. Studies such as   are trying to learn more about the causes of type 1 diabetes.   and other groups are working to find treatments that may prevent or slow the development of type 1 diabetes in people who are at risk for getting the disease. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes develops when your pancreas doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin, and your body has trouble using insulin, a condition called  . Insulin resistance is when the cells in your muscles, fat, and  \u00a0don\u2019t respond well to insulin. When there isn\u2019t enough insulin to balance blood glucose levels, they begin to rise. When blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes, you have a condition called  . You have type 2 diabetes when health care professionals diagnose your blood glucose  \u00a0as being too high. Researchers don\u2019t fully know what causes problems with insulin production and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. However, people are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if they You can\u2019t change some of these risk factors, such as your age, family history, or race. However, you may be able to change some risk factors and  \u00a0by maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and stopping smoking. Gestational diabetes occurs when your body can\u2019t make the extra insulin that you need during pregnancy. Scientists believe that substances made in your body, called hormones, may play a role in causing this form of diabetes. Changes to hormones during pregnancy can make it harder for blood glucose to enter the cells in your body. This causes insulin resistance. In most pregnancies, the pancreas can make enough insulin to overcome these changes. If the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin, you\u2019ll develop gestational diabetes. You\u2019re more likely to develop gestational diabetes if you have certain risk factors, such as Other causes of diabetes may include  are changes to certain genes. Some gene variants can cause diseases that can affect the pancreas and lead to diabetes.  is a group of rare forms of diabetes caused by a variant, or change, in a single gene. Parents may pass these gene variants to their children. In some cases, a person may be the first one with the variant in the family. Most forms of monogenic diabetes reduce the amount of insulin your pancreas can make.  is a genetic disease that leads to swelling and scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.  is a genetic condition that causes your body and organs to build up harmful levels of  . If the disease is not treated, high levels of iron may damage your pancreas and other organs. Some endocrine diseases make the body produce too much of certain hormones. High levels of these hormones may cause insulin resistance or diabetes. Endocrine diseases that may cause insulin resistance or diabetes include The pancreas can be damaged by injury or diseases such as inflammation of the pancreas, also called  . Diabetes may be the first sign of   in older people without diabetes risk factors who develop diabetes. A damaged pancreas may make less insulin and lead to diabetes. In some cases, your pancreas may need to be removed. Without a pancreas, your body can\u2019t produce insulin. You\u2019ll develop diabetes and will have to take insulin. Certain medicines may harm the pancreas or affect the way insulin works in the body. Some of these medicines may include Statins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you\u2019ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from   and  . For this reason, the strong benefits of taking statins outweigh the small chance that you could develop diabetes. If you take medicines for these conditions, you may want to ask your primary health care professional if your medicines could affect your risk of developing diabetes. NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and improve quality of life. Clinical trials\u2014and other types of  \u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you.

The A1C test can be used to diagnose   and  .  The A1C test is also the primary test used for  . The A1C test is sometimes called the hemoglobin A1C, HbA1c, glycated hemoglobin, or glycohemoglobin test. Hemoglobin is the part of a red blood cell that carries oxygen to the cells. Glucose attaches to or binds with hemoglobin in your blood cells, and the A1C test is based on this attachment of glucose to hemoglobin. The higher the glucose level in your bloodstream, the more glucose will attach to the hemoglobin. The A1C test measures the amount of hemoglobin with attached glucose and reflects your average blood glucose levels over the past 3 months. The A1C test result is reported as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood glucose levels have been. A normal A1C level is below 5.7 percent. Testing can help health care professionals If you have  , talk with your doctor about whether you should be tested. Health care professionals can use the A1C test alone or in combination with   to diagnose type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. You don\u2019t have to   before having your blood drawn for an A1C test, which means that blood can be drawn for the test at any time of the day. If you don\u2019t have symptoms but the A1C test shows you have diabetes or prediabetes, you should have a repeat test on a different day using the A1C test or one of the other diabetes tests to confirm the diagnosis. When using the A1C test for diagnosis, your doctor will send your blood sample taken from a vein to a lab that uses an NGSP-certified method.  , formerly called the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program, certifies that makers of A1C tests provide results that are consistent and comparable with those used in the  . Blood samples analyzed in a doctor\u2019s office or clinic, known as point-of-care tests, should not be used for diagnosis. The A1C test should not be used to diagnose  ,  , or  -related diabetes. The A1C test may give  . Having prediabetes is a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. Within the prediabetes A1C range of 5.7 to 6.4 percent, the higher the A1C, the greater the risk of diabetes. Health care professionals may use the A1C test early in pregnancy to see if a woman with risk factors had undiagnosed diabetes before becoming pregnant. Since the A1C test reflects your average blood glucose levels over the past 3 months, testing early in pregnancy may include values reflecting time before you were pregnant. The   or the  (OGTT) are used to check for  , usually between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. If you had gestational diabetes, you should be tested for diabetes no later than 12 weeks after your baby is born. If your blood glucose is still high, you may have type 2 diabetes. Even if your blood glucose is normal, you still have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes in the future and should get tested every 3 years. Yes. Health care professionals also use the   and the OGTT to diagnose type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. For these  , you must fast at least 8 hours before you have your blood drawn. If you have symptoms of diabetes, your doctor may use the  , which doesn\u2019t require fasting. In some cases, health care professionals use the A1C test to help confirm the results of another blood glucose test. Yes. In some people, a blood glucose test may show diabetes when an A1C test does not. The reverse can also occur\u2014an A1C test may indicate diabetes even though a blood glucose test does not. Because of these differences in test results, health care professionals repeat tests before making a diagnosis. People with differing test results may be in an early stage of the disease, when blood glucose levels have not risen high enough to show up on every test. In this case, health care professionals may choose to follow the person closely and repeat the test in several months. Lab test results can vary from day to day and from test to test. This can be a result of the following factors: Your results can vary because of natural changes in your blood glucose level. For example, your blood glucose level moves up and down when you eat or exercise. Sickness and stress also can affect your blood glucose test results. A1C tests are less likely to be affected by short-term changes than FPG or OGTT tests. The following chart shows how multiple blood glucose measurements over 4 days compare with an A1C measurement. The straight black line shows an A1C measurement of 7.0 percent. The blue line shows an example of how blood glucose test results might look from self-monitoring four times a day over a 4-day period. Conditions that change the life span of red blood cells, such as recent blood loss,  ,   treatment,  , or transfusion, can change A1C levels. A falsely high A1C result can occur in people who are very low in iron; for example, those with  . Other causes of false A1C results include   or  . If you\u2019re of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent or have family members with sickle cell anemia or a  , an A1C test can be unreliable for diagnosing or monitoring diabetes and prediabetes. People in these groups may have a different type of hemoglobin, known as a hemoglobin variant, which can interfere with some A1C tests. Most people with a hemoglobin variant have no symptoms and may not know that they carry this type of hemoglobin. Health care professionals may suspect interference\u2014a falsely high or low result\u2014when your A1C and blood glucose test results don\u2019t match. Not all A1C tests are unreliable for people with a hemoglobin variant. People with false results from one type of A1C test may need a different type of A1C test to measure their average blood glucose level. The NGSP provides information for health care professionals about  . Read about  . The NIDDK has information for health care providers on  . Even when the same blood sample is repeatedly measured in the same lab, the results may vary because of small changes in temperature, equipment, or sample handling. These factors tend to affect glucose measurements\u2014fasting and OGTT\u2014more than the A1C test. Health care professionals understand these variations and repeat lab tests for confirmation. Diabetes develops over time, so even with variations in test results, health care professionals can tell when overall blood glucose levels are becoming too high. When repeated, the A1C test result can be slightly higher or lower than the first measurement. This means, for example, an A1C reported as 6.8 percent on one test could be reported in a range from 6.4 to 7.2 percent on a repeat test from the same blood sample.  In the past, this range was larger but new, stricter quality-control standards mean more precise A1C test results. Health care professionals can visit   to find information about the precision of the A1C test used by their lab. Your health care professional may use the A1C test to set your treatment goals, modify therapy, and monitor your diabetes management. Experts recommend that people with diabetes have an A1C test at least twice a year.  Health care professionals may check your A1C more often if you aren\u2019t meeting your treatment goals. People will have different A1C targets, depending on their diabetes history and their general health. You should discuss your A1C target with your health care professional. Studies have shown that some people with diabetes can reduce the risk of   by keeping A1C levels below 7 percent. Managing blood glucose early in the course of diabetes may provide benefits for many years to come. However, an A1C level that is safe for one person may not be safe for another. For example, keeping an A1C level below 7 percent may not be safe if it leads to problems with  , also called low blood glucose. Less strict blood glucose control, or an A1C between 7 and 8 percent\u2014or even higher in some circumstances\u2014may be appropriate in people who have . Some laboratories report eAG with A1C test results. The eAG number helps you relate your A1C to daily glucose monitoring levels. The eAG calculation converts the A1C percentage to the same units used by home glucose meters\u2014milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). The eAG number will not match daily glucose readings because it\u2019s a long-term average\u2014rather than your blood glucose level at a single time, as is measured with a home glucose meter. Large changes in your blood glucose levels over the past month will show up in your A1C test result, but the A1C test doesn\u2019t show sudden, temporary increases or decreases in blood glucose levels. Even though A1C results represent a long-term average, blood glucose levels within the past 30 days have a greater effect on the A1C reading than those in previous months. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.

You can see what your blood glucose level is at any time. You can also review how your blood glucose level changes over a few hours or days and spot trends. Seeing your blood glucose levels in real time can help you  \u00a0about the food and beverages you consume, the physical activity you do, and the medicines you take. Keeping your blood glucose level in your target range can help  . A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) estimates what your glucose level is every few minutes and keeps track of it over time. A CGM has three parts. First, there is a tiny sensor that can be inserted under your skin, often the skin on your belly or arm, with a sticky patch that helps it stay there. These sensors are called disposable sensors. Another type of CGM sensor\u2014called an implantable sensor\u2014may be placed inside your body. CGM sensors estimate the glucose level in the fluid between your cells, which is very similar to the glucose level in your blood. Sensors must be replaced at specific times, such as every few weeks, depending on the type of sensor you have. The second part of the CGM is a transmitter. The transmitter sends the information, without using wires, to the third part, a software program that is stored on a smartphone, on an  , or on a separate device called a receiver. Your doctor may recommend that you use a CGM if you need  \u00a0to manage  ,  , or another form of diabetes. Talk with your doctor about whether using a CGM could help you manage your diabetes. Doctors can prescribe CGMs for adults and children. Some models can be used for children as young as 2 years old. Your doctor may suggest using a CGM all the time or only for a few days to help adjust your diabetes care. All CGMs estimate blood glucose levels, but they store and display the information in different ways. Some CGMs send and display information to your smartphone or receiver automatically. These CGMs are called \u201creal-time\u201d CGM devices. Another type of CGM, called \u201cintermittent-scan,\u201d estimates glucose levels continuously. But you will need to scan the CGM with a separate receiver or smartphone every few hours to view and store the data. A third type of CGM collects data about your blood glucose level for your doctor to download and review later. Doctors provide this type of CGM to check on your diabetes care, and you wear it for a limited time. Other differences between CGM models include For some CGM models, you may need to do a finger-stick test with a standard blood glucose monitor to calibrate the system and make sure the CGM readings are correct. When worn, CGMs are always on and recording glucose levels\u2014whether you\u2019re showering, working, exercising, or sleeping. Many CGMs work with apps that have special features, such as For safety, it is important to act quickly if a CGM alarm sounds when your glucose level is too low or too high. You should get help or follow your treatment plan to bring your glucose level into a healthy range. Some CGM models can also send information to a second person\u2019s smartphone\u2014such as a parent, partner, or caregiver. For example, if a child\u2019s glucose level drops dangerously low overnight, the CGM could be set to wake a parent in the next room. Compared with a standard blood glucose meter, using a CGM can help you The CGM will create an alert and might display a graphic that shows whether your glucose level is rising or dropping\u2014and how quickly\u2014so you can choose the best way to reach your target range. Over time, keeping your glucose levels in the healthy range can help you stay well and prevent diabetes complications. The people who benefit the most from a CGM are those who use it every day or nearly every day. Researchers are working to make CGMs more accurate and easier to use. However, you may experience some issues while using a CGM. For safety, you may sometimes need to compare your CGM glucose readings with a finger-stick test and a standard blood glucose meter. This could be needed if you doubt the accuracy of your CGM readings, if you are changing your insulin dose, or if your CGM gives a warning alert. You might have to replace parts of your CGM over time. Disposable CGM sensors should be replaced every 7 to 14 days, depending on the model. Some implantable sensors can last up to 180 days. You may have to replace the transmitters of some CGMs. You may also need to reconnect the CGM, transmitter, and receiver or smartphone if your CGM is not working correctly. Skin redness or irritation from the sticky patches used to attach the sensor may occur for some people.  Your doctor can suggest techniques or medicines to help relieve skin problems. A CGM costs more than using a standard glucose meter, but it may be covered by your health insurance. You might be able to get  \u00a0from your health insurance or other resources. Check with your health insurance plan or   to see if the costs will be covered. An  , also called an automated insulin delivery system (AID), mimics how a healthy  \u00a0controls blood glucose in the body. A CGM, an insulin pump, and a software program that shares information between the CGM and insulin pump make up the artificial pancreas. The CGM estimates glucose levels and wirelessly sends the information to a software program on a smartphone or insulin pump. The program calculates how much insulin your body needs, and the insulin pump delivers the insulin when glucose levels rise higher than your target range. On the other hand, if your glucose levels fall lower than your target range, the artificial pancreas can lower or stop the amount of insulin given by the insulin pump. The artificial pancreas is mainly used to help people with type 1 diabetes keep their glucose levels in their target range. NIDDK has a long-standing commitment to funding research to better understand diabetes and improve the lives of people with the disease. NIDDK-funded research helped scientists learn that glucose levels in the fluid between cells could be used to estimate blood glucose levels.  This discovery helped create the CGMs that people with diabetes use today. NIDDK also supported the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, which showed that people with diabetes could use blood glucose monitors at home to closely control their blood glucose levels and reduce their risk of health problems. NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials for many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. Trials look for new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life. Clinical trials\u2014and other types of  \u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future. Researchers are studying many aspects of CGMs, such as how CGMs could be made more sensitive, reliable, and comfortable to wear. Researchers are also studying how they might be used to manage different types of diabetes or other medical conditions. . Watch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P.

Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood glucose drops too low. Certain diabetes medicines make low blood glucose more likely. You can prevent hypoglycemia by following your meal plan and balancing your physical activity, food, and medicines. Testing your blood glucose regularly can also help prevent hypoglycemia. Diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage that can result from diabetes. Different types of nerve damage affect different parts of your body. Managing your diabetes can help prevent nerve damage that affects your feet and limbs, and organs such as your heart. Diabetic kidney disease, also called diabetic nephropathy, is kidney disease caused by diabetes. You can help protect your kidneys by managing your diabetes and meeting your blood pressure goals. Diabetes can cause nerve damage and poor blood flow, which can lead to serious foot problems. Common foot problems, such as a callus, can lead to pain or an infection that makes it hard to walk. Get a foot checkup at each visit with your health care team. Diabetes can damage your eyes and lead to low vision and blindness. The best way to prevent eye disease is to manage your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol; and to not smoke. Also, have a dilated eye exam at least once a year. Diabetes can lead to problems in your mouth, such as infection, gum disease, or dry mouth. To help keep your mouth healthy, manage your blood glucose, brush your teeth twice a day, see your dentist at least once a year, and don\u2019t smoke.

You might be afraid you\u2019ll lose a toe, foot, or leg to diabetes, or know someone who has, but you can lower your chances of having diabetes-related foot problems by taking care of your feet every day. Managing your blood glucose levels, also called blood sugar, can also help keep your feet healthy. Over time, diabetes may cause nerve damage, also called  , that can cause tingling and pain, and can make you lose feeling in your feet. When you lose feeling in your feet, you may not feel a pebble inside your sock or a blister on your foot, which can lead to cuts and sores. Cuts and sores can become infected. Diabetes also can lower the amount of blood flow in your feet. Not having enough blood flowing to your legs and feet can make it hard for a sore or an infection to heal. Sometimes, a bad infection never heals. The infection might lead to  . Gangrene and foot ulcers that do not get better with treatment can lead to an   of your toe, foot, or part of your leg.\nA surgeon may perform an amputation to prevent a bad infection from spreading to the rest of your body, and to save your life. Good foot care is very important to prevent serious infections and gangrene. Although rare, nerve damage from diabetes can lead to changes in the shape of your feet, such as  . Charcot\u2019s foot may start with redness, warmth, and swelling. Later, bones in your feet and toes can shift or break, which can cause your feet to have an odd shape, such as a \u201crocker bottom.\u201d Work with your health care team to make a diabetes self-care plan, which is an action plan for how you will manage your diabetes. Your plan should include foot care. A foot doctor, also called a podiatrist, and other specialists may be part of your health care team. Include these steps in your foot care plan: You may have foot problems, but feel no pain in your feet. Checking your feet each day will help you spot problems early before they get worse. A good way to remember is to check your feet each evening when you take off your shoes. Also check between your toes. If you have trouble bending over to see your feet, try using a mirror to see them, or ask someone else to look at your feet.  Look for problems such as If you have certain foot problems that make it more likely you will develop a sore on your foot, your doctor may recommend taking the temperature of the skin on different parts of your feet. A \u201chot spot\u201d can be the first sign that a blister or an ulcer is starting. Cover a blister, cut, or sore with a bandage. Smooth corns and calluses as explained below. Wash your feet with soap in warm, not hot, water. Test the water to make sure it is not too hot. You can use a thermometer (90\u00b0 to 95\u00b0 F is safe) or your elbow to test the warmth of the water. Do not soak your feet because your skin will get too dry. After washing and drying your feet, put talcum powder or cornstarch between your toes. Skin between the toes tends to stay moist. Powder will keep the skin dry to help prevent an infection. Thick patches of skin called corns or calluses can grow on the feet. If you have corns or calluses, talk with your foot doctor about the best way to care for these foot problems. If you have nerve damage, these patches can become ulcers. If your doctor tells you to, use a pumice stone to smooth corns and calluses after bathing or showering. A pumice stone is a type of rock used to smooth the skin. Rub gently, only in one direction, to avoid tearing the skin. Do  Cutting and over-the counter corn removal products can damage your skin and cause an infection. To keep your skin smooth and soft, rub a thin coat of lotion, cream, or petroleum jelly on the tops and bottoms of your feet. Do not put lotion or cream between your toes because moistness might cause an infection. Trim your toenails, when needed, after you wash and dry your feet. Using toenail clippers, trim your toenails straight across. Do not cut into the corners of your toenail. Gently smooth each nail with an emery board or nonsharp nail file. Trimming this way helps prevent cutting your skin and keeps the nails from growing into your skin. Have a foot doctor trim your toenails if If you want to get a pedicure at a salon, you should bring your own nail tools to prevent getting an infection. You can ask your health care provider what other steps you can take at the salon to prevent infection. Wear shoes and socks at all times. Do not walk barefoot or in just socks \u2013 even when you are indoors. You could step on something and hurt your feet. You may not feel any pain and may not know that you hurt yourself. Check the inside of your shoes before putting them on, to make sure the lining is smooth and free of pebbles or other objects. Make sure you wear socks, stockings, or nylons with your shoes to keep from getting blisters and sores. Choose clean, lightly padded socks that fit well. Socks with no seams are best. Wear shoes that fit well and protect your feet. Here are some tips for finding the right type of shoes: When breaking in new shoes, only wear them for a few hours at first and then check your feet for areas of soreness.  and other health insurance programs may help pay for these special shoes or inserts. Ask your insurance plan if it covers your special shoes or inserts. If you have nerve damage from diabetes, you may burn your feet and not know you did. Take the following steps to protect your feet from heat: Wear socks in bed if your feet get cold. In the winter, wear lined, waterproof boots to keep your feet warm and dry. Try the following tips to improve blood flow to your feet: Smoking can lower the amount of blood flow to your feet. If you smoke, ask for help to stop. You can get help by calling the national quitline at 1-800-QUITNOW or 1-800-784-8669. For tips on quitting, go to  . Ask your health care team to check your feet at each visit. Take off your shoes and socks when you\u2019re in the exam room so they will remember to check your feet. At least once a year, get a thorough foot exam, including a check of the feeling and pulses in your feet.

An artificial pancreas is mainly used to help people with  . In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce  . People with type 1 diabetes control their blood glucose level by checking it and taking insulin, either by  , several times a day. An artificial pancreas automatically monitors your blood glucose level, calculates the amount of insulin\u00a0you need at different points during the day, and delivers it. Most artificial pancreas systems require you to count and enter the amount of carbohydrates you consume at mealtime. These are called \u201chybrid\u201d artificial pancreas systems, because some of the insulin is given automatically and some is given based on the information you enter. These systems help control blood glucose levels throughout the day and night, making it easier for people with type 1 diabetes to keep their blood glucose level in range. Keeping blood glucose levels in range will prevent  \u00a0from developing and may improve daily life for people with type 1 diabetes. Three devices make up an artificial pancreas system. A  \u00a0tracks blood glucose levels every few minutes using a tiny sensor that is inserted under the skin. The sensor wirelessly sends the information to a program stored on a smartphone or on an insulin infusion pump. The program calculates how much insulin is needed and signals the insulin infusion pump when insulin needs to be delivered. Other names for the artificial pancreas include automated insulin-delivery system closed-loop system bionic pancreas threshold suspend and predictive suspend systems insulin-only systems dual hormone systems The threshold suspend and predictive suspend systems can temporarily stop or \u201csuspend\u201d delivering insulin if your blood glucose level gets low. The threshold suspend system stops delivering insulin when your blood glucose level drops to a pre-set level. The predictive suspend system calculates your blood glucose level and will stop delivering insulin before your blood glucose level gets too low. Neither system automatically increases insulin doses. Stopping insulin delivery at the right moment can help a person with type 1 diabetes avoid  , a condition when a person\u2019s blood glucose level is lower than their target range. These systems may help people with type 1 diabetes who develop hypoglycemia overnight, particularly children. Insulin-only systems keep your blood glucose level within your target range by automatically increasing or decreasing the amount of insulin delivered to your body based on your CGM values. Insulin-only systems can increase insulin doses if your blood glucose level is higher than your target range. One type of insulin-only system is the hybrid system. The hybrid insulin-only system automatically adjusts insulin doses in response to your CGM values. But you must still count carbohydrate levels and calculate insulin doses for all meals and snacks. Researchers are currently developing and testing systems that use two hormones\u2014insulin to lower glucose levels and  \u00a0to raise blood glucose levels. Using two hormones to control blood glucose is similar to the way the pancreas works in people who do not have diabetes. These systems may be able to tightly control glucose levels without causing hypoglycemia. Researchers are also testing how well other combinations, such rapid-acting insulin and  , can control blood glucose levels. You need a prescription from your doctor to get an artificial pancreas. Together, you and your doctor will consider which system can best control your blood glucose levels and fit your lifestyle. Other factors to consider are age\u2014some models are approved for children as young as 2 years old, while others are approved for people ages 6 years and older whether you can place the devices in the correct position without help, check that they are working properly, and adjust them or enter carbohydrate data as needed whether you prefer an insulin pump with tubing or one that attaches directly to your skin whether you have access to a Wi-Fi network so that information can flow between the parts of the system Parents or guardians of children with type 1 diabetes should talk about appropriate artificial pancreas systems with the child\u2019s doctor. Researchers continue to develop new and different types of artificial pancreas systems that will meet the needs of people with type 1 diabetes and other types of diabetes. How much an artificial pancreas will cost you depends on your health insurance provider. Private insurance plans or government plans may not cover all artificial pancreas systems available for people with type 1 diabetes. More information on how to pay for type 1 diabetes devices and medicines is found in  . An artificial pancreas may help people with type 1 diabetes reach their target blood glucose levels and improve their quality of life. With an artificial pancreas system, your glucose levels will be monitored continuously. The computer program improves blood glucose control by automatically adjusting the amount of insulin it delivers to keep your blood glucose levels in range. The system helps you avoid hypoglycemia and  . Doctors can monitor insulin doses remotely and recommend dosage adjustments for people who need closer supervision. Also, parents or guardians can monitor blood glucose levels from their own smartphones throughout the day and night. \n Artificial pancreas systems are not completely \u201chands off.\u201d You have to regularly maintain the devices to be sure they are working properly and enter meal sizes into the system every time you eat. You will also need to check the CGM and infusion pump catheter to be sure they are in place and change them when needed check the CGM for accuracy and replace the CGM sensor from time to time count the amount of mealtime carbohydrates and enter them into the system adjust the computer program settings to make sure you get the right amount of insulin to keep your blood glucose level in your target range reboot or reconnect the CGM, infusion pump, and computer program if there are problems manage high or low blood glucose levels if the system is not able to keep your blood glucose in range The adhesive patches used with these systems may cause skin redness or irritation. Some medicines you take might also interfere with the glucose monitor. For more than 20 years, the NIDDK has funded technology to improve the lives of people with type 1 diabetes. Together with other federal government agencies and partner organizations, the NIDDK works to advance blood glucose monitoring, automate insulin delivery, and decrease complications of living with type 1 diabetes. The NIDDK supports clinical trials to test artificial pancreas systems for children,  adolescents,  and adults  with type 1 diabetes. New trials will test artificial pancreas systems in larger groups of people over longer periods of time. Recent clinical trials funded by the NIDDK have shown that artificial pancreas systems control blood glucose levels better than other methods, especially through the night\u2014a challenge for many people with type 1 diabetes\u2014and in children as young as 6 years old. Researchers continue to improve the design and components of artificial pancreas systems and to expand their use in different age groups and in real-life situations, such as during exercise.
