How This Feature Works (Example User Flow)
User selects a prompt (e.g., “Predict my A1c based on my data.”)
AdeleAI checks available data and assigns a Confidence Score (F-A or %).
✅ If enough data exists → AdeleAI answers immediately.
❌ If data is missing, AdeleAI suggests: “I need at least 3 months of glucose logs to make an accurate prediction. Would you like to start tracking this data?”
User can tap “Remind Me” to queue missing inputs in QuickLog.
Over time, as the user logs more data, AdeleAI updates the Confidence Score dynamically.
Users can track their insights over time and refine their health management based on AI-powered trends.
