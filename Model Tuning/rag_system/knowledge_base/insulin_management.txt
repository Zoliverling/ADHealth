Insulin Management Guidelines

Insulin Types and Duration:
- Rapid-acting: Onset 15 min, Peak 1-2 hrs, Duration 2-4 hrs
- Short-acting: Onset 30 min, Peak 2-3 hrs, Duration 3-6 hrs
- Intermediate-acting: Onset 2-4 hrs, Peak 4-12 hrs, Duration 12-18 hrs
- Long-acting: Onset 2 hrs, No peak, Duration 24+ hrs

Insulin-to-Carb Ratios:
- Typical starting ratios: 1 unit per 10-15g carbs
- May vary by time of day and individual needs
- Should be adjusted based on post-meal glucose patterns

Correction Factor Guidelines:
- Typical starting point: 1 unit lowers glucose by 50 mg/dL
- Individual correction factors vary
- Consider active insulin time (insulin on board)

Safety Considerations:
- Never stack insulin doses (wait appropriate time between doses)
- Account for exercise and activity
- Consider illness and stress factors
- Monitor for patterns of highs and lows

Storage and Handling:
- Unopened: Refrigerate (36-46°F)
- In-use: Room temperature (<86°F)
- Protect from extreme temperatures
- Check expiration dates
- Inspect for clarity before use
