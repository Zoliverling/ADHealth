  * Monitor more frequently
  * Review carbohydrate intake

Low Blood Glucose (Hypoglycemia):
- Levels below 70 mg/dL are considered low
- Severe hypoglycemia: below 54 mg/dL
- Immediate actions:
  * Consume 15-20g fast-acting carbohydrates
  * Recheck blood sugar after 15 minutes
  * Repeat treatment if still low
  * Once normalized, consider a small snack with protein
